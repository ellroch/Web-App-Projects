                the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's

                out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
                and above it there hung a picture that he had recently
                cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
                gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat
                and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that
                covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor
                then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
